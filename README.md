             Movie Database Application

Abstract:
    This document outlines a comprehensive project plan for developing a movie database application that allows users to search for movies and view detailed information using a movie API, such as the OMDB API. The application will feature a user-friendly interface designed with Tailwind CSS for responsive design. Users will be able to view a list of movies based on their search queries, including essential details like movie posters, titles, and release dates. Additionally, users can click on a movie to access more in-depth information, including plot summaries, cast details, and ratings. The final application will be deployed on a platform like Netlify or Vercel.
